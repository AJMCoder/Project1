# Project1
My first project.
Commands to push changes to Git:

git add .
git commit -m "{Describe your commit}"
git push

To pull updates locally: git pull

De-bugging: 
Fixed issue where cover-text wasnt displaying over tennis-player image. Section tags were not surrounding the cover-text id meaning they were not wrapped in the Tennis player image selection. I moved tags to surround both and fixed issue.
