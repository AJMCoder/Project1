### De-bugging: 
- Fixed issue where cover-text wasnt displaying over tennis-player image. Section tags were not surrounding the cover-text id meaning they were not wrapped in the Tennis player image selection. I moved tags to surround both and fixed issue.
- Fixed an issue with CSS where I had not added 'rgb' before selecting a colour value which meant the style wasn't changing to the colour i wanted.
- Fixed an issue with README file where i was trying to link images to my file. I realised i had added a space between the brackets which broke the link between the what is was trying to show and the image link.
- Fixed and issue within the html files where images were not being linked due to the image names in the 'image' file not being correctly identified. I changed the image label to not include a space and then changed the code within the html which fixed the link and allowed the image to be displayed.
