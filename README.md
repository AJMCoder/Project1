# Project1
All4Tennis is a site aimed at anyone and everyone. Our goal is to encourage as many as we can into the sport of tennis as believe it to be the best. The target audience of All4Tennis are those individuals who are looking for a way to learn a new skill, or build up their strength, or even just want to socialise with new people and have fun. This website is here to guide and offer a snapshot into what tennis has to offer, and help point them in the right direction of where and how to get involved.

Features

Existing features: 
The navigation bar is a full responsive feature that links to the sections of the website it outlines. Clicking the website logo also acts as a button back to the top of the home page. The other navigation links: 'What We Offer' and 'ABout Us' - allows users to navigate to the different sections clearly and easily on all devices, and makes all sections accessible at any point during their visit to the site.



De-bugging: 
Fixed issue where cover-text wasnt displaying over tennis-player image. Section tags were not surrounding the cover-text id meaning they were not wrapped in the Tennis player image selection. I moved tags to surround both and fixed issue.
